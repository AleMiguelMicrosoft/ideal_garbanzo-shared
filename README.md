# Glucose Level Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict dangerously high glucose levels for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes using historical data. By analyzing patterns in glucose levels, food intake, insulin doses, physical activity, and other relevant factors, we can forecast potential risk periods and notify users in advance.

## Features
- Real-time glucose level monitoring.
- Predictive analytics for identifying risk periods.
- Alerts for high-risk glucose levels.
- Data visualization for glucose trends.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
python >= 3.6
pandas

```

Install required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
How to use the program. Include examples for common use cases.

```python
# Example of how to use the script to predict glucose levels
from predictor import GlucoseLevelPredictor

predictor = GlucoseLevelPredictor()
predictor.load_data('path/to/data.csv')
prediction = predictor.predict()
print(prediction)
```
